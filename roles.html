            <h3>Table Topics</h3>
            <p>
              At every meeting, we practice Table Topics, which is an exercise in extemporaneous
              speaking and thinking on your feet. You'll never be caught off guard by unexpected
              dinner conversation again.

            <p>
              Central to the Toastmasters philosophy is feedback - it's how we get better. Via
              evaluations, we encourage an atmosphere of constructive, positive feedback that helps
              us all grow and improve.
