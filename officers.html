          by Vanderbilt Toastmasters to help you succeed at your next meeting! <br /><br />

            <h2 class="meeting-roll">Toastmaster</h2>
            <p>
              As Toastmaster, you serve as the meeting's <b>director, host, and emcee</b>.
              Additionally, you select the week's meeting theme. <br /><br />
              Your role involves working with the VPE and General Evaluator to ensure all club
              participants know their responsibilities for the week, introducing speakers during the
              club meeting (reach out to them before the meeting to get their speech title, project
              title, objectives, delivery time, and a short bio), and ensure smooth transitions
              throughout the meeting. <br /><br />
              When conducting transitions, Vanderbilt Toastmasters encourages having the Toastmaster
              of the Day share fun facts related to the meeting's theme to lighten the mood.

            <h2 class="meeting-roll">Speaker</h2>
            <p>
              As a Speaker, you serve as a role model for all members and guests. Your
              responsibilities include preparing, rehearsing, and delivering a speech during your
              next meeting. Additionally, you should be sure to discuss your goals, strengths and
              weaknesses with your evaluator prior to giving your speech. <br /><br />
              Your speeches may be a part of the
              <a href="https://www.toastmasters.org/pathways-overview">Pathways Curriculum</a>; if
              you're new to Toastmasters, we recommend starting here. If you've been around for a
              while and are still using the legacy curriculum, feel free to continue on that path.
              Regardless, you can always speak to your VPE to determine the best path forward for
              you.
            </p>

            <i class="icon major meeting-rolls fas fa-question"></i>
            <h2 class="meeting-roll">Topics Master</h2>
            <p>
              As Topicsmaster, you deliver the Table Topics® portion of the meeting, which helps
              train members to quickly organize and express their thoughts in an impromptu manner.
              <br /><br />
              Before the meeting, coordinate with the Toastmaster of the Day to obtain the meeting
              theme and generate topics related to the theme which allow speakers to express their
              opinions. You should also focus on giving members who aren't assigned a speaking role
              during the meeting the opportunity to speak by volun<i>telling</i> them to deliver an
              impromptu Table Topics® speech.

            <h2 class="meeting-roll">General Evaluator</h2>
            <p>
              As General Evaluator, you evaluate everything that takes place during the club
              meeting. Additionally, you serve as the leader for the evaluation team (Ah Counter,
              Wordmaster/Grammarian, and Timer).
              <br /><br />
              Additional responsibilities include ensuring other evaluators know their
              responsibilities, explaining the purpose and process of evaluations to the meeting,
              and taking notes on the meeting's timeliness, enthusiasm, and organization for your
              General Evaluator's report at the end of the meeting.
            </p>

            <h2 class="meeting-roll">Speech Evaluator</h2>
            <p>
              As a Speech Evaluator, your role is critical to producting the constructive feedback
              which is the heart of the Toastmasters program. Before your upcoming meeting, ask
              those you've been assigned to evaluate what they will present and what they wish to
              achieve.
              <br /><br />
              During your assigned speakers' speeches, take notes so you can deliver and objective
              2-3 minute verbal evaluation for them at the end of the meeting before giving them
              your written evaluation. We recommend following the
              <b>C</b>ommendation, <b>R</b>ecommendation, and <b>E</b>ncouragement style of
              feedback. <br /><br />
              To further prepare for your role, be sure to review Toastmasters International's
              <a

            <h2 class="meeting-roll">Wordmaster/Grammarian</h2>
            <p>
              As Wordmaster/Grammarian, your role is twofold.
              <br /><br />
              As Wordmaster, you should select an interesting word for the Word of the Week. Then,
              throughout the meeting, record the number of times each speaker uses the Word of the
              Week. Finally, at the end of the meeting, report who used the word the most and award
              a prize/kudos as appropriate.
              <br /><br />
              As Grammarian, note any egregious uses of the English language or grammar mistakes
              throughout the meeting. This includes incomplete sentences, mispronunciations,
              grammatical mistakes, non-sequiturs, malapropisms, etc. At the end of the meeting,
              report these errors and how to correct them.

          <section>
            <i class="icon major meeting-rolls fas fa-stopwatch"></i>
            <h2 class="meeting-roll">Timer</h2>
            <p>
              As Timer, you're responsible for monitoring time for each meeting segment and each
              speaker.
              <br /><br />
              Before the meeting, be sure to obtain the timing cards from the Sergeant at Arms and
              know the time allotments for each speaker. At the beginning of the meeting, explain
              your role and what each meeting segment's time allotment is. Then, throughout the
              meeting, be sure to time each portion of the meeting (you can use your phones's
              stopwatch) and record each time so you may deliver a report at the end of the meeting
              for each speaker's time taken.
            </p>

            <i class="icon major meeting-rolls fas fa-ban"></i>
            <h2 class="meeting-roll">Ah-Counter</h2>
            <p>
              As Ah-Counter, your responsibility is to
              <b>note any overused words or filler sounds</b> used as a crutch by anyone who speaks
              during the meeting. Words may be inappropriate interjections, such as <i>like</i>,
              <i>so</i>, <i>so</i>, and <i>you know</i>. Sounds may be <i>ah</i>, <i>um</i> or
              <i>er</i>.<br /><br />
              At the end of the meeting, be prepared to report of how many crutches were used by
              every person who spoke during the meeting. If someone uses greater than five crutches,
              we recommend reporting that they used
              <i>greater than five</i> rather than the exact number - those speakers can approch you
              after the meeting for an exact count.
